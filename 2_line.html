            <h2>Western Asia stands out with a significant gender disparity in its immigrant population.</h2>
            <p> Over the years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of male immigrants compared to
                females in
                this region.

        This trend suggests that Western Asia has become a destination that attracts a larger number of
        male
        immigrants,
        possibly due to factors such as employment opportunities or specific industries. The disproportionate
        gender
        composition in Western Asia raises questions about the underlying causes and implications of this
        phenomenon.
